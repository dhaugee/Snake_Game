## Rules
* The "head" of the snake moves forward without stopping, growing one square larger and incrementing the score for every red pellet it eats.
* Hitting a wall or the snake's body with its head ends the game. The goal is to get the highest possible score while maneuvering the snake right, left, forward and backwards.
## Playing the Game
* Enter "python3 main.py" on the command-line to start the game.
* Use the arrow keys to control the snake, and press t to restart at any time.
